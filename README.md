## Jackbox Switcher
A small tool for jumping between the [Jackbox Party Packs](https://www.jackboxgames.com/). Kills off previously launched pack and then launches the desired pack.

## Motivation
I tend to host and stream gaming sessions for friends and in my quest to be lazy, I wanted something simple to switch between the game packs so I could minimise gameplay intervals.

## Screenshots
Coming soon...

## Features
- Launch Jackbox Party Packs at the click of a button
